# bootcamp

Welcome to bootcamp for Datamatch's Web team! This is a 6 week bootcamp, starting June 1st, to expose you to the frameworks and tools used to build Datamatch itself. It will introduce you to many concepts used in industry and ways to think about system and security design. (Everyone who finishes this bootcamp will be considered for the Datamatch Web Lead role!)

Every week, I will post a video going over some concepts and doing some programming live. Then, there will be some tasks to finish, usually a new feature to implement and exercise your understanding of the material. You'll then submit what you have to me at the end of each week for me to review (mostly for completion). Each week's material will build upon each other (instead of mini disjoint projects).

Even though the bootcamp officially begins the week of **6/1**, much of the material is self-paced and can be done whenever comfortable.

## What do I get out of this?
At Harvard, there aren't exactly many opportunities to get your hands on practical programming used in the real world/industry. Hopefully, this bootcamp will give you a sense of what creating a user-focused project is like and all the tools to do so! Moreover, with the completion of this bootcamp, you will have the opportunity to join Datamatch's Web team to work on Datamatch itself and Meet 24, a mini Datamatch for incoming first-years.

## Prerequisites
The simple prerequisite is CS50 programming level. The main thing here is to have knowledge of programming in Javascript. If you aren't sure if you have the prereqs, feel free to reach out to me and I'd love to discuss more!

## Tasks ("Assignments")
Every week, there will be a handful of tasks required to finish that week's material. If you don't finish the week's material, I'll be posting my "solutions" to that week's material after the deadline. But! If you don't do the week's material, you won't understand it as well; you might have trouble following future weeks material, etc. If you need more time to complete the material, I am more than flexible! Just email me or Slack me.

## Time commitment
5-10 hours a week, depending on your prior experiences. It might take you more time in reality to really grasp concepts, but the more you put into this, the more you will get out of it. There will be plenty of extra opportunities and tasks I will post, which are 100% optional.

## Getting help
I will be hosting "office hours," where people can drop in and ask questions about tasks, bugs, conceptual misunderstandings or confusions, any questions in general or to just hang out! You can also reach me via email and on Slack.
